### Activity 1.4: Reading/writing to disc, packages, functions ###


#### Activity 1.4.1: Working directory and sourcing files

The code samples above assume the data files are located in
the R working directory, which can be found with the
function `getwd()`.

```{r}
getwd()
```

All files visible from R should be accessed relative to the
working directory.

Let's create a new directory and then set it as the
working directory
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
dir.create("working_tmp")
setwd("working_tmp")
getwd()
```

Write a one-line text file ('\n' means new line).
```{r}
cat("This is one-line file\n", file = "tmpFile.txt")
```

Now look at the contents of the directory.
```{r}
dir()
```

Delete the file.
```{r}
unlink("tmpFile.txt")
```

Go back to the original working directory.  The "../" is the
Unix/Linux notation for moving up one directory.  This
syntax will work in Windows too.
```{r}
setwd("../")
```

Note that the forward slash should be used as the path
separator even on Windows, for example:
`setwd("C:/Users/Me/Documents")`

When you have a large amount of code in a separate file that
you'd like to run all at once, use the `source()` function.
Let's illustrate by writing some R code to a text file using
`cat()`. The "\n" are newline characters.
```{r}
cat("x <- 10\n",
    "y <- 20\n",
    "x + y",
    sep = "",
    file = "tmp1_code.R")
```

Now "tmp1_code.R" should be in your working directory.  We
can verify using `dir()`.
```{r}
dir(pattern = "tmp1_")
```

Now we can source (i.e. run) the code in the file.  The
`echo` argument displays each line as it runs.
```{r}
source("tmp1_code.R", echo = TRUE)
```

Having sourced the file, let's remove it.
```{r}
unlink("tmp1_code.R")
```


#### Activity 1.4.2: Read and write data to/from disc


There are lots of ways to read data into R.  One of the
easiest is to write your data (perhaps from Excel) to a csv
(Comma Separated Variable) file and then read it into R.

Read in 20 rows of NetFlow data from local disk
into local a data frame object that we'll call nfHead.
```{r}
nfHead <- read.csv("nf-week2-sample.csv", nrows = 20)
```

Look at the structure of nfHead.  Notice that by default,
R converts all character variables to factors, because the
data can be stored more efficiently that way.
```{r}
str(nfHead)
```

We can surpress this behavior by using the
`stringsAsFactors = FALSE` argument in `read.csv()`.
```{r}
nfHead <- read.csv("nf-week2-sample.csv", nrows = 20,
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Notice that the factor variables are now character.
```{r}
str(nfHead)
```

Let's create a new subset of the data and write the results
back to disk.
```{r}
nfSub <- nfHead[1:5, c("parsedDate", "firstSeenSrcIp",
                       "firstSeenSrcTotalBytes")]
nfSub
```

Now write the file to disk.
```{r}
write.csv(nfSub, file = "a_temporary_subset.csv",
          row.names = FALSE)
```

If we call the `dir()` function, you should see the new
csv file listed in the working directory.  If you are
using a Windows machine, you could open this file in Excel.
```{r}
dir(pattern = "csv")
```

Now we can delete the file (from R).
```{r}
unlink("a_temporary_subset.csv")
```

We can also save nfSub as an R data object, this will only
be readable by R. (But it will be readable by R on any
operating system:  Windows, Mac, or Linux).
```{r}
save(nfSub, file = "a_temporary_subset.Rdata")
dir(pattern = "Rdata")
```

And since we've saved it, we can remove the data frame from
R's memory.
```{r}
rm(nfSub)
```

If we want to load some existing data that are stored in
the Rdata format, we do the following:
```{r}
objectName <- load("a_temporary_subset.Rdata")
```

Note that `objectName` is a character vector that indicates
the name(s) of the R object(s) that were read from the Rdata
file.
```{r}
objectName
```

And a call to `ls()` shows us the `nfSub` object exists in R's
memory.
```{r}
"nfSub" %in% ls()
```

And if you need more convicing it's really there:
`head()` lets us look at the first 6 lines of an object
```{r}
head(nfSub)
```

And now we delete the Rdata file on disk.
```{r}
unlink("a_temporary_subset.Rdata")
```

#### Exercise 1.4.2: Read and write data to/from disc
1) Verify that the file "some_fake_data.csv" is in your
   working directory using `dir()`.

2) Read the file "some_fake_data.csv" to a data frame.

2) Create a subset of the data by selecting the
   first and last columns whenever the second column is
   less than 7.  Try to use the column names when
   accessing the data frame, as it's generally a better
   programming practice.

3) Write the resulting data frame to a new csv file, called
   "more_fake_data.csv".  Use the `write.csv()` function.


#### Activity 1.4.3: Installing packages
Often times, you'll want to use methods or functions in
R that are available only through contributed packages that
don't come pre-installed with R.  The `xtable` package is an
example of a widely used package that converts data frames
and matrices into LaTeX or html tables.

Prior to installation, let's create a directory where R
will install the package. This step is not usually required
if you are installing a package on your own computer.
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
dir.create("Rlibs")
```

To install `xtable`, we use the install.packages() function.
The `libs` argument tells R where to install the package on
your computer.  Once again, if you own the computer, this
the `lib` argument is not usually necessary. The "repos"
argument allows you to specify a CRAN mirror.  For this
example, we'll use the CRAN mirror at Case Western University.
If you omit the "repos" argument, R will prompt you with a
pop-up window to select a CRAN mirror. Typically, you want
to choose a mirror that is geographically close to you.
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
install.packages("xtable", lib = "Rlibs",
                 repos = "http://cran.case.edu")
```

Once we have installed the `xtable` package, we need
to load it with `library()` in order to use it.  Again,
we need to tell R where to look for the library, since
we installed it to the "Rlibs" directory.  For your
own computer, the `lib.loc` argument is not usually
necessary.
```{r}
library(xtable, lib.loc = "Rlibs")
```


All good packages have documentation for their functions.
Let's look at the help for the `xtable()` function.
```{r}
?xtable
```

Suppose we wanted to create an html table for
a portion of the mtcars data with the vehicles that have
high power and relatively good gas mileage:
```{r}
indicator <- (mtcars[,"hp"] > 150) & (mtcars[,"mpg"] > 15)
mtSub <- mtcars[indicator, c("hp", "mpg")]
```

Now create the html table that we can copy and paste to
an html editor using `xtable()` from the xtable package.
```{r}
mtSub.xtable <- xtable(mtSub)
print(mtSub.xtable, type = "html")
```

We can also render the table for use in a LaTeX document:
```{r}
print(mtSub.xtable)
```

#### Activity 1.4.4: Making your own functions
Functions are the core computational unit of R.  To the
extent possble, good R coders divide their work into modular,
generalizable, and reusable pieces of code that are
often writen as functions.

All functions in R have inputs (arguments) and outputs
(values).  Let's define a function called `simple()` that
adds two numbers together and substracts 7.
```{r}
simple <- function(x, y) {
  return(x + y - 7)
}
```

To display the function, simply type it's name.
```{r}
simple
```

To call the function, add in parameter values for x and y.
```{r}
simple(4, 7)
```

Note how we can put vectors in the arguments.
```{r}
simple(1:3, 5:7)
```

Here's function with both unnamed and named arguments and
some if/else statements.  Notice the indentation! This is
a standard coding practice for readability.  Here, `x` is an
unnamed argument, and `method` is a 'named' argument because
it has a default value.
```{r}
simp1 <- function(x, method = "sum") {

  if (method == "sum") {
    out <- sum(x)
  }
  else if (method == "prod") {
    out <- prod(x)
  }
  else {
    stop("'method' must be 'sum' or 'prod'")
  }

  return(out)

}
```

Let's try it using the default for the `method` argument.
Note that the unnamed argument, `x`, must be supplied in
order for the function to be called, whereas the named
argument, `method`, will use the default value if nothing
is supplied for it.
```{r}
simp1(1:7)
```

Equivalenty we could have called:
```{r}
simp1(1:7, method = "sum")
```

And now for the product, assigning the result to `x`.
```{r}
x <- simp1(1:7, method = "prod")
x
```

And this will throw the error. We'll wrap it in
the `try()` function which will keep the error from crashing
this script when it is sourced (i.e. run all at once).
```{r}
try(simp1(1:7, method = "granny"))
```

Here's a function with a `for` loop that returns nothing.
But it does print the iterations of the loop.  Notice the
commenting inside the function.  Commenting is essential for
readability! With liberal use of comments, you (at the
very least) will know what you were doing if you revisit
the code in the future.
```{r}
simp2 <- function(begin, long = TRUE) {

  # Determine the value of 'end' depending on the value of
  # 'long'
  if (long) {
    end <- begin + 10
  }
  else {
    end <- begin + 5
  }

  # A for loop from begin to end that prints each value in the
  # loop
  for (i in begin:end) {
    cat("Iteration", i, "\n")
  }

}
```

Call it long:
```{r}
simp2(3)
```

Call it short:
```{r}
simp2(3, long = FALSE)
```

In some cases, you need to return more than one object from
your function.  The standard way to do this in R is to
return a list.  (MANY of the base and contributed
functions in R return lists).  Here's how:
```{r}
simp3 <- function(x, y) {

  return(list(sum = x + y,
              product = x * y,
              quotient = x / y))

}
```

Upon calling the function, notice it how the named list is
returned.
```{r}
simp3(3, 7)
```

We can call it and extract the `sum` from the list.
```{r}
simp3(3, 7)$sum
```

Or you can extract using brackets:
```{r}
simp3(3, 7)["sum"]
simp3(3, 7)[1]
```

And recall, if you want to strip the label name, use the
double brackets [[]]:
```{r}
simp3(3, 7)[["sum"]]
simp3(3, 7)[[1]]
```

Or call it, assign the output to an object, and then extract
the last two elements:
```{r}
y <- simp3(3, 7)
y[2:3]
```

Many R coders do not use the `return()` function at the end
of their function definitions. I prefer to use `return()` for
readability and clarity of the code but, technically, it is
redundant.  The last object that is stated at the end of the
function is automatically returned, as illustrated here:
```{r}
simp4 <- function(x, y) {

    z1 <- x + 7
    z2 <- z1 * y

    # z2 is returned
    z2

}
```

Call the function.
```{r}
simp4(3, -2)
```

What if the output you return from a function is so large
you would never want to have it displayed on the screen?  R
has a nice trick for this:  the `invisible()` function.
```{r}
simp5 <- function(n) {

  # Make a vector
  x <- 1:n

  # Write a message that tells you the mean of the vector
  cat("The mean of the numbers from 1 to", n, "is", mean(x),
      "\n")

  # Invisibly return the vector
  invisible(x)

}
```

Now, if I call the function without assigning it to an
object, the value `x` is not returned.  Only the `cat()`
statement is printed.
```{r}
simp5(100)
```

But if I assign it to an object, the vector is returned
and assigned to the object.
```{r}
y <- simp5(100)
head(y)
tail(y)
```

Functions can also be defined without arguments.  A common
reason to do this might be to wrap a large script into a
single unit of code.  This can be especially helpful
if you need to write code with control statements (e.g.,
if/then/else statements, for/while loops, etc.).  Control
statements behave better in R if they are encapsulated
within a function.
```{r}
simp6 <- function() {

  # Take 1 random draw from a poisson distribution with mean 20
  aRandomPoissonNumber <- rpois(1, lambda = 20)

  # Create some text to return
  textToReturn <- paste("A random Poisson variate:",
                        aRandomPoissonNumber)

  # Return the text string
  return(textToReturn)

}

```

Call it
```{r}
simp6()
simp6()
```


#### Exercise 1.4.4: Making your own functions
1) Create a function that takes two numerical, unnamed
   arguments, (say, `x` and `y`) and a single named argument
   that will determine whether your function multiplies
   (the default) or divides your two numeric arguments,
   `x` and `y`.

2) Call the function using scalar inputs for `x` and `y`
   such that `x` is multiplied by `y`.

3) Call the function using vector inputs for `x` and `y`
   such that `x` is divided by `y`.
