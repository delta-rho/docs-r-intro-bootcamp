## Activity 1: Introduction to R ##

### Activity 1.2: Getting Started ###

#### Activity 1.2.1: Help commands


When you don't know exactly what you're looking for,
search for a topic.  There are two ways to do this:

```{r}
help.search("graphics")
??graphics
```

When you know the name of the R function, e.g. the function
`print()`, there are two ways to do this:
```{r}
help(print)
?print
```


Sometimes you just need a reminder about the arguments (the
inputs) of a function.  The `args()` function can help in
this situation.  Here are the arguments for the `rnorm()`
function, which generates normal random variates:
```{r}
args(rnorm)
```

Examples are often included in the documentation of functions
at the bottom of the documentation.  Look at:

```{r}
?seq
```

You can execute the example code for a function all at once
using the `example()` function:

```{r}
example(seq)
```

#### Activity 1.2.2: Demos


Some R packages include demonstrations you can run to learn
about their capability.  Be sure to hit "Enter" to
cycle through the components of each demo.

Here's one from the `graphics` package, which gives a nice
demonstration of the breadth of graphical capability in R.

```{r}
demo("graphics")
```

And here's one about generalized linear models (glm):
```{r}
demo(lm.glm)
```


#### Activity 1.2.3:  R as a calculator
Addition:
```{r}
7 + 3
```

Subtraction:
```{r}
7 - 3
```

Multiplication:
```{r}
7 * 3
```

Division:
```{r}
7 / 3
```

Integer division:
```{r}
7 %/% 3
```

Division remainder (the modulo):
```{r}
7 %% 3
```

exponentiation:
```{r}
exp(7)
```

Natural logarithm:
```{r}
log(7)
```

Base 10 log:
```{r}
log10(1000)
```

Examples of common mathematical functions and constants:
```{r}
sqrt(16)
cos(pi)
```

Powers:  2 to the 5th:
```{r}
2^5
```

Large and small numbers:
```{r}
1.7e+05
1.7e-03
```

And there are numerous statistical functions.  For example:
The probability a standard normal random variable takes
a value of 1.96 or lower:
```{r}
pnorm(1.96)
```

And the probability of 4 heads in 12 fair coin flips:
```{r}
dbinom(4, 12, 0.5)
```

And, best of all, it handles division by 0 gracefully :) 
```{r}
1 / 0
```

R can also perform all the standard matrix operations:
inner and outer products, matrix multiplication, matrix
inversion, transpose, eigen vectors and values, various
decompositions, etc.  It has built-in numerical routines for
root-finding, optimization, integration, differentiation,
etc.
